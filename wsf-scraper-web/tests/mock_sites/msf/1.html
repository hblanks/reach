<p><strong>March 2018</strong></p>

<p>MSF estimates that at least 9,400 people lost their lives in Myanmar between 25 August and 24 September, of whom at least 6,700 died due to violence. At least 730 children under the age of five are estimated to have been killed.</p>

<p>While the speed and scale of displacement alerted the international community to the severity of events, MSF mortality data indicates that violence reached an unprecedented level in the month following 25 August 2017.</p>

<p>This contrasts sharply with official statements from the Myanmar authorities denying any wrongdoing in Rakhine State, and underestimating casualties caused by the so-called clearance operations.</p>

<p>An estimated 500,000 people cross into Mexico every year. The majority making up this massive forced migration flow originate from El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, known as the Northern Triangle of Central America (NTCA) - one of the most violent regions on Earth</p>

<p>This report compiles two years of data from our teams in Mexico, highlighting huge levels of violence experienced by migrants in transit through the country - and the systemic failings of the governments meant to protect them.</p>

<p>Our teams have witnessed and documented a pattern of violent displacement, persecution, sexual violence, and forced repatriation akin to the conditions found in the deadliest armed conflicts in the world today.</p>



<p><strong><a href="https://www.msf.org.uk/sites/uk/files/msf-taiz-war_and_healthcare-lr-singlepages-def.pdf">Yemen: Healthcare under siege in Taiz</a><br />
January 2017</strong></p>

<p>After almost two years of continuous fighting, the medical-humanitarian situation in Taiz, Yemen’s third most populous city, is extremely dire and only seems likely to further deteriorate. Shelling, airstrikes, crossfire, landmines and snipers are consistently injuring, maiming and killing local residents, while access to lifesaving healthcare has become increasingly limited.</p>

<p>This report focuses on the direct impact of the war on the population of Taiz, the collapse of the health services in the divided city and the human suffering of the war on the population as observed by MSF teams in Taiz.</p>

October 2016</strong></p>

<p>Over what has now been nearly six years of war, Syrians have suffered immeasurably. Amidst the  brutality of the Syrian conflict, violence against medical facilities, staff and patients has become horrifyingly routine. This report examines the direct and indirect factors that are driving changes in medical practice in Syria.</p>

The statement published expressed MSF’s lack of hope that the WHS will address the weaknesses in humanitarian action and emergency response, particularly in conflict areas or epidemic situations.</p>

<p>Instead, the WHS’s focus would seem to be an incorporation of humanitarian assistance into a broader development and resilience agenda. Further, the summit neglects to reinforce the obligations of states to uphold and implement the humanitarian and refugee laws which they have signed up to.</p>

<p>MSF has been significantly engaged in the WHS process over the past 18 months, and this report summarises our reflections on some of the key themes in the ‘Agenda for Humanity’ put out by the UN Secretary General.</p>

April 2016</strong></p>

<p>Our observations highlight the urgent need to overcome the current status quo and develop an adapted fast-track action framework for the countries in West and Central Africa.</p>

<p>Concrete proposals for a catch-up plan to close the treatment gap in West and Central Africa are included in this report, including the call to triple ART initiations by 2020 in countries with less than 50 percent HIV treatment coverage, and to transfer knowledge and experience from places that have effectively rolled-out ART provision.</p>

<p>'Return to Abuser' uncovers the gaps in services and systems in Papua New Guinea, trapping women and children in cycles of severe family and sexual violence.</p>

<p>The report details how a dire lack of protection mechanisms, a weak justice system and a culture of impunity endanger the health and lives of patients in Papua New Guinea even if they manage to reach medical care.</p>

<p>Five years of unrelenting violence in Syria has left thousands of ordinary men, women and children with devastating injuries, yet unable to get the specialist medical care they need in Syria’s overwhelmed field hospitals. In this report, MSF describes the challenges and successes of providing medical care in Jordan to victims of the Syrian war, while MSF’s patients tell their own, often heartbreaking, stories.</p>

<h3>2015 reports</h3>

<p><strong><a href="/sites/uk/files/turning-a-blind-eye.pdf">Turning a blind eye: How Europe ignores the consequences of outsourced migration management</a><br />

<p>According to the Office for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), by 29 October 2015, 705,251 people had arrived by sea to Europe, a huge increase on the 216,054 new arrivals by sea for the whole of 2014.</p>

<p>The crisis comes on top of another crisis, one in part created by the European Union (EU) and its member states’ ever-increasing efforts to "seal off" the continent – i.e. the constant, often silent and sometimes violent pushing-back of people considered to be irregularly entering Europe.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.msf.org.uk/sites/uk/files/final_rapport_epidemies_eng.pdf">Epidemics: Neglected emergencies?</a><br />
October 2015</strong></p>

<p>The Ebola outbreak that hit West Africa in 2014 dominated the headlines for months, eclipsing coverage of other medical emergencies.</p>

<p>It was an enormously important crisis, with many lessons learned during the response phase and with much work remaining to be done. But if we focus too intently on any single disease, we risk overlooking less spectacular but far more common outbreaks of measles, malaria, cholera, and meningitis that take place every year, with profound consequences and loss of life.  </p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.msf.org.uk/sites/uk/files/ebola_accountability_report_final_july_low_res.pdf">An unprecedented year: MSF's response to the largest ever Ebola outbreak</a><br />
June 2015</strong></p>

<p>On 22 March 2014, an Ebola epidemic was officially declared in Guinea. Over the course of the next year, the virus would infect more than 25,000 people in nine countries and claim more than 10,000 lives, dwarfing all previous Ebola outbreaks. For comparison, the biggest previous outbreak had a total of 425 cases.</p>

<p>This is our accountability report.</p>

March 2015</strong></p>

<p>A year into the outbreak, many questions abound. How did the epidemic spiral so spectacularly out of control? Why was the world so slow to wake up to its severity and respond? Was it due to fear, lack of political will, lack of expertise, or a perfect storm of all three?</p>

<p>Did MSF make the right choices? How could MSF have done more and saved more lives? What have we learned from this outbreak and what must be done differently in future? There are many questions and few simple answers.</p>

January 2015</strong></p>

<p>The way in which the Syria war has been fought - and the regional geo-political dynamics that frame it - has resulted in a polarised aid environment.</p>

<p>At the core of the challenges facing MSF institutionally in Syria is the reality that the aid landscape has drastically shifted, and MSF is no longer an insider to the aid system, able to criticise the failings of the system from within, while relying on certain operational alliances with NGOs that essentially have the same ‘principles’.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.msf.org.uk/sites/uk/files/humanitarian_aid_landscape_-_philippines.pdf">Philippines Typhoon Haiyan response​</a><br />
January 2015</strong></p>

<p>Typhoon Haiyan was a major natural disaster that overwhelmed the capacities of the national and local governments in the Philippines. The international humanitarian system mounted a massive response, and, due to the Government’s openness to receive aid, a wide range of actors responded. Despite this MSF’s interaction with them was entirely pragmatic, based on operational need.</p>

<p>This paper attempts to shed light, on the one hand, on the changing landscape of aid actors in Mali with a special attention to the “new” actors; and, on the other hand, to MSF’s relationships (or lack of thereof) with these actors and the factors that shape these relationships.</p>

<h3>2014 reports</h3>

<p><br /><a href="http://www.msf.org.uk/sites/uk/files/msfbriefjuly2014pushingtheenvelopefinal.pdf"><strong>Pushing the envelope</strong></a><br />
August 2014</p>

<p>The Global Fund is by far the biggest contributor to the fight against the three largest killer diseases: HIV, TB and malaria. It gets its funding by donor countries who pool their resources into the Global Fund. It has introduced recently a new model to fund those diseases which is having very concrete impact on the ground, which is what this brief examines.</p>

<p>Considering the Global Fund has a budget of 16 billion dollars in the next four years its new funding model has a direct impact on the 12 million people currently on HIV treatment (it directly finances care for half of the total, six million people), and to the 16 million people who are HIV positive and don’t have access to treatment yet. </p>

Some good work is taking place, and lives are being saved, but much more can, and should be done, to reach those people most in need.</p>

<p>In 2016 the World Humanitarian Summit brought together global experts in aid to consider the structure and funding of humanitarian work in the future. In parallel to this important meeting, MSF is publishing Where is everyone?, a report which diagnoses some of the key issues inherent in the international response to humanitarian crises.</p>

May 2014</strong></p>

<p>Central to the work of MSF are its patients – the people affected by distress and conflict whom MSF seeks to treat. MSF’s medical and operational staff, both international and national, choose to bring their humanitarian imperative and medical ethics as close to their patients as a medical humanitarian organisation should.</p>

<p>But while MSF ensures proximity to its patients and their communities, it is acutely conscious that crossing the geographic and cultural barriers to be with its patients in times of crisis demands more than medical skill and logistical know-how. Providing optimal medical care to its patients requires detailed understanding of their political and cultural context, their needs and habits, and the impact on them of the crises that MSF is there to address.</p>

February 2014</strong></p>

<p>2014 is another crucial year for Afghanistan: after 12 years the US-led NATO military intervention in the country has entered its final phase, and presidential and provincial elections are scheduled for April. As the bulk of international troops withdraw before the end of the year, the world's attention is rapidly turning elsewhere.</p>

<p>What interest remains in Afghanistan is firmly fixed on military drawdown, security transition and pre-electoral wrangling. Conspicuously lacking is a focus on the daily reality for Afghans, trapped in an escalating conflict - indeed 2013 was reportedly the second most violent year for civilians since 2001.</p>

<p>Over the last ten years, as the European Union (EU) has tightened its border controls and increasingly externalised its migration policies, Morocco has changed from being just a transit country for migrants en route to Europe to being both a transit and destination country by default.

<p>After two years of an extremely violent conflict which has resulted in more than 70,000 dead according to the UN, the Syrian people are faced with a humanitarian catastrophe.

<p>Yet the response to the epidemic remains inadequate. With 94 percent of patients at risk of MDR-TB (those previously treated) not having access to tests capable of diagnosing MDR-TB, and only 19 percent of people with MDR-TB having been enrolled on treatment in 2011, the full extent of the burden is unknown and undertreated.</p>

<p>There is emerging evidence that the needs of older people in crises have not been properly addressed by emergency aid.

<p>While significant gains made in the fight against HIV/AIDS in the past decade are encouraging, countries most affected by the pandemic continue to struggle to place enough people on treatment and to implement the best science and strategies to fight the disease.

<p>In this report, MSF calls on all key stakeholders to assure quality rapid TB diagnosis, treatment and care, and argues that a scale-up of the decentralised and community-based approach, including access to second-line TB drugs at district level, is the most feasible method of averting Uganada's impending TB crisis.</p>

November 2011</strong></p>

<p>The Central African Republic (CAR) today finds itself in a state of chronic medical emergency. Five separate retrospective mortality surveys, carried out by MSF and other researchers, in prefectures accounting for the majority of the population, show excess mortality above what is considered to be the “emergency threshold.”</p>

October 2011</strong></p>

<p>Tuberculosis (TB) is a curable disease that kills nearly 1.45 million people across the globe each year and is the main cause of death for people living with HIV/AIDs. Of the 8.8 million new tuberculosis cases each year, 440,000 are forms of the disease that are multidrug-resistant, meaning they cannot be treated with the two primary antibiotics used to treat TB.</p>

<h3>2010 reports</h3>

December 2014</strong></p>

<p>During 2009 and 2010 there were regional outbreaks of measles in central and southern Africa. The measles outbreaks were all distinct in nature, but similar in terms of the burden they represented on health services, and in their ability to cause fatalities. This report aims to highlight the main challenges of dealing with such outbreaks and the ways in which the responses deviated from optimal response strategies, in preparation for developing advocacy strategies for outbreaks of similar scope within the region. </p>

April, 2010</strong></p>

<p>The people of Turkmenistan are being failed by their healthcare system, by their government, and by the international community. The system that is supposed to ensure their health is instead designed to conceal problems. This is not a case of individual practitioners failing to do their jobs but one that is far more systematic.</p>

<p>This briefing paper highlights the problem of sexual violence against Sub-Saharan migrant women, who arrive in Morocco on their way to Europe. Through the data and testimonies gathered in its medical-humanitarian projects, Médecins Sans Frontières hopes to contribute to finding a comprehensive answer to this problem, which increasingly affects more, and younger, women.</p>

November, 2008</strong></p>

<p>Thousands of people are needlessly dying due to a severe lack of lifesaving HIV/AIDS treatment in Myanmar. Unable to continue shouldering the primary responsibility for responding to one of Asia’s worst HIV crises, MSF insists that the government of Myanmar and other international organisations urgently and rapidly scale-up the provision of antiretroviral therapy.</p>

<p>In a new report launched today, MSF said many more lives can be saved if newer effective strategies to tackle malaria are more widely implemented. The report describes the organisation’s work in Sierra Leone, Chad and Mali, and shows that unnecessary deaths can be avoided with simple, affordable treatment and diagnostic tools available today.</p>
