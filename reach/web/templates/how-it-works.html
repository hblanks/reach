          <p>A piece of software called a ‘scraper’ is used to extract documents from the websites of the organisations we have selected. The scraper navigates through a website and clicks on all the links. Where a link leads to a PDF it is downloaded and the text is extracted and stored in the cloud.</p>

          <h3 class="category-title">2. Extract</h3>
          <p>The text extracted from each PDF is divided into sections and the references section is extracted. An algorithm identifies sections by looking for titles in the text. When the titles have been identified, they are scanned for words like ‘references’, ‘bibliography’ or ‘end notes’. Sections of text with titles containing these words are selected for the next stage.</p>

          <p>The extracted references sections are split into individual references using machine learning. A machine learning algorithm identifies the start and end of a reference and divides the reference section into individual references.</p>

          <p>This step converts the raw text data into a structured form by extracting the individual parts of a reference. A reference is made up of a number of parts, such as the author, publication date, journal and the title of the publication. A machine learning algorithm identifies each part of each reference and adds it to a structured data set. </p>

          <h3 class="category-title">3. Match</h3>
          <p>Once the parts of each reference have been extracted into a structured data set, that data set is compared with the EPMC database of scientific publications. References with the same title as a publication in EPMC are matched. This step checks that Reach has identified scientific publications from the downloaded PDFs. </p>
