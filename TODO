- fix scrapes so that JOBDIR writes to a directory that
  we delete after completion of scrape (instead of /tmp/crawls)
- standardize on a single set of wrappers for writing files
  to disk / S3, json.gz or not (or just always both).
- add back URI to refparse by getting URI into the manifest
  and having it flow through pdf parsing to it.
